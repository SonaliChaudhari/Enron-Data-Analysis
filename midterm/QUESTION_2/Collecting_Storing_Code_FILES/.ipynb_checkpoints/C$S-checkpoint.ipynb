There was the death of the legendary driver Dale Earnhardt in a stock car crash.

But on a gleaming late-summer morning, there were those planes bearing down on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Suddenly, Americans had no sense of what the future might bring. As the shock and the tears subsided, faces that had been purposeful were newly diffident. And in the changed world of politics, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, prevented by New York City's term-limits law from seeking a third term, prepared to leave City Hall celebrating his much-heralded leadership.\",\n",

Reports by the Reuters and Agence France-Presse news services that appeared after midnight on Sunday in Islamabad quoted an unnamed senior security official as saying that Mr. Saeed, founder and leader until last week of the Army of the Pure, had been arrested ''for making inflammatory speeches to incite people to violate law and order.'' The arrest had appeared to be imminent for several days as Pakistan sought ways of defusing the crisis with India.\",\n",

There was the death of the legendary driver Dale Earnhardt in a stock car crash. There was Cal Ripken's retirement after 3,001 games, including a record 2,632 in a row (and 3,184 hits, 1,695 runs batted in and 431 homers). There was Robert Tools's quiet thumbs-up after becoming the first recipient of a self-contained artificial heart. But on a gleaming late-summer morning, there were those planes bearing down on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Suddenly, Americans had no sense of what the future might bring. As the shock and the tears subsided, faces that had been purposeful were newly diffident. And in the changed world of politics, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, prevented by New York City's term-limits law from seeking a third term, prepared to leave City Hall celebrating his much-heralded leadership.\",\n",

As the shock and the tears subsided, faces that had been purposeful were newly diffident. And in the changed world of politics, Mayor Rudolph W.

Reports by the Reuters and Agence France-Presse news services that appeared after midnight on Sunday in Islamabad quoted an unnamed senior security official as saying that Mr. Saeed, founder and leader until last week of the Army of the Pure, had been arrested ''for making inflammatory speeches to incite people to violate law and order.'' The arrest had appeared to be imminent for several days as Pakistan sought ways of defusing the crisis with India.\",\n",

There was the death of the legendary driver Dale Earnhardt in a stock car crash. There was Cal Ripken's retirement after 3,001 games, including a record 2,632 in a row (and 3,184 hits, 1,695 runs batted in and 431 homers). There was Robert Tools's quiet thumbs-up after becoming the first recipient of a self-contained artificial heart. But on a gleaming late-summer morning, there were those planes bearing down on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Suddenly, Americans had no sense of what the future might bring. As the shock and the tears subsided, faces that had been purposeful were newly diffident. And in the changed world of politics, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, prevented by New York City's term-limits law from seeking a third term, prepared to leave City Hall celebrating his much-heralded leadership.\",\n",

And some of it was significant. There was the swearing in of a president after the Supreme Court decided the presidential election. There was the death of the legendary driver Dale Earnhardt in a stock car crash. There was Cal Ripken's retirement after 3,001 games, including a record 2,632 in a row (and 3,184 hits, 1,695 runs batted in and 431 homers). There was Robert Tools's quiet thumbs-up after becoming the first recipient of a self-contained artificial heart. But on a gleaming late-summer morning, there were those planes bearing down on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Suddenly, Americans had no sense of what the future might bring. As the shock and the tears subsided, faces that had been purposeful were newly diffident. And in the changed world of politics, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, prevented by New York City's term-limits law from seeking a third term, prepared to leave City Hall celebrating his much-heralded leadership.\",\n",

And some of it was significant. There was the swearing in of a president after the Supreme Court decided the presidential election. There was the death of the legendary driver Dale Earnhardt in a stock car crash. There was Cal Ripken's retirement after 3,001 games, including a record 2,632 in a row (and 3,184 hits, 1,695 runs batted in and 431 homers). There was Robert Tools's quiet thumbs-up after becoming the first recipient of a self-contained artificial heart. But on a gleaming late-summer morning, there were those planes bearing down on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Suddenly, Americans had no sense of what the future might bring. As the shock and the tears subsided, faces that had been purposeful were newly diffident. And in the changed world of politics, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, prevented by New York City's term-limits law from seeking a third term, prepared to leave City Hall celebrating his much-heralded leadership.\",\n",

There was the death of the legendary driver Dale Earnhardt in a stock car crash.

As the shock and the tears subsided, faces that had been purposeful were newly diffident. And in the changed world of politics, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, prevented by New York City's term-limits law from seeking a third term, prepared to leave City Hall celebrating his much-heralded leadership.\",\n",

And some of it was significant. There was the swearing in of a president after the Supreme Court decided the presidential election.

There was the death of the legendary driver Dale Earnhardt in a stock car crash.

As the shock and the tears subsided, faces that had been purposeful were newly diffident. And in the changed world of politics, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, prevented by New York City's term-limits law from seeking a third term, prepared to leave City Hall celebrating his much-heralded leadership.\",\n",

There was the death of the legendary driver Dale Earnhardt in a stock car crash.

There was Robert Tools's quiet thumbs-up after becoming the first recipient of a self-contained artificial heart.

As the shock and the tears subsided, faces that had been purposeful were newly diffident. And in the changed world of politics, Mayor Rudolph W.

And some of it was significant. There was the swearing in of a president after the Supreme Court decided the presidential election. There was the death of the legendary driver Dale Earnhardt in a stock car crash. There was Cal Ripken's retirement after 3,001 games, including a record 2,632 in a row (and 3,184 hits, 1,695 runs batted in and 431 homers). There was Robert Tools's quiet thumbs-up after becoming the first recipient of a self-contained artificial heart. But on a gleaming late-summer morning, there were those planes bearing down on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Suddenly, Americans had no sense of what the future might bring. As the shock and the tears subsided, faces that had been purposeful were newly diffident. And in the changed world of politics, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, prevented by New York City's term-limits law from seeking a third term, prepared to leave City Hall celebrating his much-heralded leadership.\",\n",

The arrest had appeared to be imminent for several days as Pakistan sought ways of defusing the crisis with India.\",\n",

And some of it was significant. There was the swearing in of a president after the Supreme Court decided the presidential election. There was the death of the legendary driver Dale Earnhardt in a stock car crash. There was Cal Ripken's retirement after 3,001 games, including a record 2,632 in a row (and 3,184 hits, 1,695 runs batted in and 431 homers). There was Robert Tools's quiet thumbs-up after becoming the first recipient of a self-contained artificial heart. But on a gleaming late-summer morning, there were those planes bearing down on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Suddenly, Americans had no sense of what the future might bring. As the shock and the tears subsided, faces that had been purposeful were newly diffident. And in the changed world of politics, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, prevented by New York City's term-limits law from seeking a third term, prepared to leave City Hall celebrating his much-heralded leadership.\",\n",

Reports by the Reuters and Agence France-Presse news services that appeared after midnight on Sunday in Islamabad quoted an unnamed senior security official as saying that Mr. Saeed, founder and leader until last week of the Army of the Pure, had been arrested ''for making inflammatory speeches to incite people to violate law and order.'' The arrest had appeared to be imminent for several days as Pakistan sought ways of defusing the crisis with India.\",\n",

There was the death of the legendary driver Dale Earnhardt in a stock car crash. There was Cal Ripken's retirement after 3,001 games, including a record 2,632 in a row (and 3,184 hits, 1,695 runs batted in and 431 homers). There was Robert Tools's quiet thumbs-up after becoming the first recipient of a self-contained artificial heart. But on a gleaming late-summer morning, there were those planes bearing down on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Suddenly, Americans had no sense of what the future might bring. As the shock and the tears subsided, faces that had been purposeful were newly diffident. And in the changed world of politics, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, prevented by New York City's term-limits law from seeking a third term, prepared to leave City Hall celebrating his much-heralded leadership.\",\n",

As the shock and the tears subsided, faces that had been purposeful were newly diffident. And in the changed world of politics, Mayor Rudolph W.

Reports by the Reuters and Agence France-Presse news services that appeared after midnight on Sunday in Islamabad quoted an unnamed senior security official as saying that Mr. Saeed, founder and leader until last week of the Army of the Pure, had been arrested ''for making inflammatory speeches to incite people to violate law and order.'' The arrest had appeared to be imminent for several days as Pakistan sought ways of defusing the crisis with India.\",\n",

There was the death of the legendary driver Dale Earnhardt in a stock car crash. There was Cal Ripken's retirement after 3,001 games, including a record 2,632 in a row (and 3,184 hits, 1,695 runs batted in and 431 homers). There was Robert Tools's quiet thumbs-up after becoming the first recipient of a self-contained artificial heart. But on a gleaming late-summer morning, there were those planes bearing down on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Suddenly, Americans had no sense of what the future might bring. As the shock and the tears subsided, faces that had been purposeful were newly diffident. And in the changed world of politics, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, prevented by New York City's term-limits law from seeking a third term, prepared to leave City Hall celebrating his much-heralded leadership.\",\n",

And some of it was significant. There was the swearing in of a president after the Supreme Court decided the presidential election. There was the death of the legendary driver Dale Earnhardt in a stock car crash. There was Cal Ripken's retirement after 3,001 games, including a record 2,632 in a row (and 3,184 hits, 1,695 runs batted in and 431 homers). There was Robert Tools's quiet thumbs-up after becoming the first recipient of a self-contained artificial heart. But on a gleaming late-summer morning, there were those planes bearing down on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Suddenly, Americans had no sense of what the future might bring. As the shock and the tears subsided, faces that had been purposeful were newly diffident. And in the changed world of politics, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, prevented by New York City's term-limits law from seeking a third term, prepared to leave City Hall celebrating his much-heralded leadership.\",\n",

And some of it was significant. There was the swearing in of a president after the Supreme Court decided the presidential election. There was the death of the legendary driver Dale Earnhardt in a stock car crash. There was Cal Ripken's retirement after 3,001 games, including a record 2,632 in a row (and 3,184 hits, 1,695 runs batted in and 431 homers). There was Robert Tools's quiet thumbs-up after becoming the first recipient of a self-contained artificial heart. But on a gleaming late-summer morning, there were those planes bearing down on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Suddenly, Americans had no sense of what the future might bring. As the shock and the tears subsided, faces that had been purposeful were newly diffident. And in the changed world of politics, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, prevented by New York City's term-limits law from seeking a third term, prepared to leave City Hall celebrating his much-heralded leadership.\",\n",

There was the death of the legendary driver Dale Earnhardt in a stock car crash.

As the shock and the tears subsided, faces that had been purposeful were newly diffident. And in the changed world of politics, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, prevented by New York City's term-limits law from seeking a third term, prepared to leave City Hall celebrating his much-heralded leadership.\",\n",

And some of it was significant. There was the swearing in of a president after the Supreme Court decided the presidential election.

There was the death of the legendary driver Dale Earnhardt in a stock car crash.

As the shock and the tears subsided, faces that had been purposeful were newly diffident. And in the changed world of politics, Mayor Rudolph W.

There was the death of the legendary driver Dale Earnhardt in a stock car crash.

There was Robert Tools's quiet thumbs-up after becoming the first recipient of a self-contained artificial heart.

As the shock and the tears subsided, faces that had been purposeful were newly diffident. And in the changed world of politics, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, prevented by New York City's term-limits law from seeking a third term, prepared to leave City Hall celebrating his much-heralded leadership.\",\n",

And some of it was significant. There was the swearing in of a president after the Supreme Court decided the presidential election. There was the death of the legendary driver Dale Earnhardt in a stock car crash. There was Cal Ripken's retirement after 3,001 games, including a record 2,632 in a row (and 3,184 hits, 1,695 runs batted in and 431 homers). There was Robert Tools's quiet thumbs-up after becoming the first recipient of a self-contained artificial heart. But on a gleaming late-summer morning, there were those planes bearing down on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Suddenly, Americans had no sense of what the future might bring. As the shock and the tears subsided, faces that had been purposeful were newly diffident. And in the changed world of politics, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, prevented by New York City's term-limits law from seeking a third term, prepared to leave City Hall celebrating his much-heralded leadership.\",\n",

The arrest had appeared to be imminent for several days as Pakistan sought ways of defusing the crisis with India.\",\n",

And some of it was significant. There was the swearing in of a president after the Supreme Court decided the presidential election. There was the death of the legendary driver Dale Earnhardt in a stock car crash. There was Cal Ripken's retirement after 3,001 games, including a record 2,632 in a row (and 3,184 hits, 1,695 runs batted in and 431 homers). There was Robert Tools's quiet thumbs-up after becoming the first recipient of a self-contained artificial heart. But on a gleaming late-summer morning, there were those planes bearing down on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Suddenly, Americans had no sense of what the future might bring. As the shock and the tears subsided, faces that had been purposeful were newly diffident. And in the changed world of politics, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, prevented by New York City's term-limits law from seeking a third term, prepared to leave City Hall celebrating his much-heralded leadership.\",\n",

Reports by the Reuters and Agence France-Presse news services that appeared after midnight on Sunday in Islamabad quoted an unnamed senior security official as saying that Mr. Saeed, founder and leader until last week of the Army of the Pure, had been arrested ''for making inflammatory speeches to incite people to violate law and order.'' The arrest had appeared to be imminent for several days as Pakistan sought ways of defusing the crisis with India.\",\n",

There was the death of the legendary driver Dale Earnhardt in a stock car crash. There was Cal Ripken's retirement after 3,001 games, including a record 2,632 in a row (and 3,184 hits, 1,695 runs batted in and 431 homers). There was Robert Tools's quiet thumbs-up after becoming the first recipient of a self-contained artificial heart. But on a gleaming late-summer morning, there were those planes bearing down on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Suddenly, Americans had no sense of what the future might bring. As the shock and the tears subsided, faces that had been purposeful were newly diffident. And in the changed world of politics, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, prevented by New York City's term-limits law from seeking a third term, prepared to leave City Hall celebrating his much-heralded leadership.\",\n",

As the shock and the tears subsided, faces that had been purposeful were newly diffident. And in the changed world of politics, Mayor Rudolph W.

Reports by the Reuters and Agence France-Presse news services that appeared after midnight on Sunday in Islamabad quoted an unnamed senior security official as saying that Mr. Saeed, founder and leader until last week of the Army of the Pure, had been arrested ''for making inflammatory speeches to incite people to violate law and order.'' The arrest had appeared to be imminent for several days as Pakistan sought ways of defusing the crisis with India.\",\n",

There was the death of the legendary driver Dale Earnhardt in a stock car crash. There was Cal Ripken's retirement after 3,001 games, including a record 2,632 in a row (and 3,184 hits, 1,695 runs batted in and 431 homers). There was Robert Tools's quiet thumbs-up after becoming the first recipient of a self-contained artificial heart. But on a gleaming late-summer morning, there were those planes bearing down on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Suddenly, Americans had no sense of what the future might bring. As the shock and the tears subsided, faces that had been purposeful were newly diffident. And in the changed world of politics, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, prevented by New York City's term-limits law from seeking a third term, prepared to leave City Hall celebrating his much-heralded leadership.\",\n",

And some of it was significant. There was the swearing in of a president after the Supreme Court decided the presidential election. There was the death of the legendary driver Dale Earnhardt in a stock car crash. There was Cal Ripken's retirement after 3,001 games, including a record 2,632 in a row (and 3,184 hits, 1,695 runs batted in and 431 homers). There was Robert Tools's quiet thumbs-up after becoming the first recipient of a self-contained artificial heart. But on a gleaming late-summer morning, there were those planes bearing down on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Suddenly, Americans had no sense of what the future might bring. As the shock and the tears subsided, faces that had been purposeful were newly diffident. And in the changed world of politics, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, prevented by New York City's term-limits law from seeking a third term, prepared to leave City Hall celebrating his much-heralded leadership.\",\n",

And some of it was significant. There was the swearing in of a president after the Supreme Court decided the presidential election. There was the death of the legendary driver Dale Earnhardt in a stock car crash. There was Cal Ripken's retirement after 3,001 games, including a record 2,632 in a row (and 3,184 hits, 1,695 runs batted in and 431 homers). There was Robert Tools's quiet thumbs-up after becoming the first recipient of a self-contained artificial heart. But on a gleaming late-summer morning, there were those planes bearing down on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Suddenly, Americans had no sense of what the future might bring. As the shock and the tears subsided, faces that had been purposeful were newly diffident. And in the changed world of politics, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, prevented by New York City's term-limits law from seeking a third term, prepared to leave City Hall celebrating his much-heralded leadership.\",\n",

There was the death of the legendary driver Dale Earnhardt in a stock car crash.

As the shock and the tears subsided, faces that had been purposeful were newly diffident. And in the changed world of politics, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, prevented by New York City's term-limits law from seeking a third term, prepared to leave City Hall celebrating his much-heralded leadership.\",\n",

And some of it was significant. There was the swearing in of a president after the Supreme Court decided the presidential election.

There was the death of the legendary driver Dale Earnhardt in a stock car crash.

As the shock and the tears subsided, faces that had been purposeful were newly diffident. And in the changed world of politics, Mayor Rudolph W.

There was the death of the legendary driver Dale Earnhardt in a stock car crash.

There was Robert Tools's quiet thumbs-up after becoming the first recipient of a self-contained artificial heart.

As the shock and the tears subsided, faces that had been purposeful were newly diffident. And in the changed world of politics, Mayor Rudolph W.

And some of it was significant. There was the swearing in of a president after the Supreme Court decided the presidential election. There was the death of the legendary driver Dale Earnhardt in a stock car crash. There was Cal Ripken's retirement after 3,001 games, including a record 2,632 in a row (and 3,184 hits, 1,695 runs batted in and 431 homers). There was Robert Tools's quiet thumbs-up after becoming the first recipient of a self-contained artificial heart. But on a gleaming late-summer morning, there were those planes bearing down on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Suddenly, Americans had no sense of what the future might bring. As the shock and the tears subsided, faces that had been purposeful were newly diffident. And in the changed world of politics, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, prevented by New York City's term-limits law from seeking a third term, prepared to leave City Hall celebrating his much-heralded leadership.\",\n",

The arrest had appeared to be imminent for several days as Pakistan sought ways of defusing the crisis with India.\",\n",

And some of it was significant. There was the swearing in of a president after the Supreme Court decided the presidential election. There was the death of the legendary driver Dale Earnhardt in a stock car crash. There was Cal Ripken's retirement after 3,001 games, including a record 2,632 in a row (and 3,184 hits, 1,695 runs batted in and 431 homers). There was Robert Tools's quiet thumbs-up after becoming the first recipient of a self-contained artificial heart. But on a gleaming late-summer morning, there were those planes bearing down on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Suddenly, Americans had no sense of what the future might bring. As the shock and the tears subsided, faces that had been purposeful were newly diffident. And in the changed world of politics, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, prevented by New York City's term-limits law from seeking a third term, prepared to leave City Hall celebrating his much-heralded leadership.\",\n",

The arrest had appeared to be imminent for several days as Pakistan sought ways of defusing the crisis with India.\",\n",

There was the death of the legendary driver Dale Earnhardt in a stock car crash. There was Cal Ripken's retirement after 3,001 games, including a record 2,632 in a row (and 3,184 hits, 1,695 runs batted in and 431 homers). There was Robert Tools's quiet thumbs-up after becoming the first recipient of a self-contained artificial heart. But on a gleaming late-summer morning, there were those planes bearing down on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Suddenly, Americans had no sense of what the future might bring. As the shock and the tears subsided, faces that had been purposeful were newly diffident. And in the changed world of politics, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, prevented by New York City's term-limits law from seeking a third term, prepared to leave City Hall celebrating his much-heralded leadership.\",\n",

As the shock and the tears subsided, faces that had been purposeful were newly diffident. And in the changed world of politics, Mayor Rudolph W.

Reports by the Reuters and Agence France-Presse news services that appeared after midnight on Sunday in Islamabad quoted an unnamed senior security official as saying that Mr. Saeed, founder and leader until last week of the Army of the Pure, had been arrested ''for making inflammatory speeches to incite people to violate law and order.'' The arrest had appeared to be imminent for several days as Pakistan sought ways of defusing the crisis with India.\",\n",

There was the death of the legendary driver Dale Earnhardt in a stock car crash. There was Cal Ripken's retirement after 3,001 games, including a record 2,632 in a row (and 3,184 hits, 1,695 runs batted in and 431 homers). There was Robert Tools's quiet thumbs-up after becoming the first recipient of a self-contained artificial heart. But on a gleaming late-summer morning, there were those planes bearing down on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Suddenly, Americans had no sense of what the future might bring. As the shock and the tears subsided, faces that had been purposeful were newly diffident. And in the changed world of politics, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, prevented by New York City's term-limits law from seeking a third term, prepared to leave City Hall celebrating his much-heralded leadership.\",\n",

And some of it was significant. There was the swearing in of a president after the Supreme Court decided the presidential election. There was the death of the legendary driver Dale Earnhardt in a stock car crash. There was Cal Ripken's retirement after 3,001 games, including a record 2,632 in a row (and 3,184 hits, 1,695 runs batted in and 431 homers). There was Robert Tools's quiet thumbs-up after becoming the first recipient of a self-contained artificial heart. But on a gleaming late-summer morning, there were those planes bearing down on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Suddenly, Americans had no sense of what the future might bring. As the shock and the tears subsided, faces that had been purposeful were newly diffident. And in the changed world of politics, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, prevented by New York City's term-limits law from seeking a third term, prepared to leave City Hall celebrating his much-heralded leadership.\",\n",

And some of it was significant. There was the swearing in of a president after the Supreme Court decided the presidential election. There was the death of the legendary driver Dale Earnhardt in a stock car crash. There was Cal Ripken's retirement after 3,001 games, including a record 2,632 in a row (and 3,184 hits, 1,695 runs batted in and 431 homers). There was Robert Tools's quiet thumbs-up after becoming the first recipient of a self-contained artificial heart. But on a gleaming late-summer morning, there were those planes bearing down on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Suddenly, Americans had no sense of what the future might bring. As the shock and the tears subsided, faces that had been purposeful were newly diffident. And in the changed world of politics, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, prevented by New York City's term-limits law from seeking a third term, prepared to leave City Hall celebrating his much-heralded leadership.\",\n",

There was the death of the legendary driver Dale Earnhardt in a stock car crash.

As the shock and the tears subsided, faces that had been purposeful were newly diffident. And in the changed world of politics, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, prevented by New York City's term-limits law from seeking a third term, prepared to leave City Hall celebrating his much-heralded leadership.\",\n",

And some of it was significant. There was the swearing in of a president after the Supreme Court decided the presidential election.

There was the death of the legendary driver Dale Earnhardt in a stock car crash.

As the shock and the tears subsided, faces that had been purposeful were newly diffident. And in the changed world of politics, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, prevented by New York City's term-limits law from seeking a third term, prepared to leave City Hall celebrating his much-heralded leadership.\",\n",

There was the death of the legendary driver Dale Earnhardt in a stock car crash.

There was Robert Tools's quiet thumbs-up after becoming the first recipient of a self-contained artificial heart.

As the shock and the tears subsided, faces that had been purposeful were newly diffident. And in the changed world of politics, Mayor Rudolph W.

And some of it was significant. There was the swearing in of a president after the Supreme Court decided the presidential election. There was the death of the legendary driver Dale Earnhardt in a stock car crash. There was Cal Ripken's retirement after 3,001 games, including a record 2,632 in a row (and 3,184 hits, 1,695 runs batted in and 431 homers). There was Robert Tools's quiet thumbs-up after becoming the first recipient of a self-contained artificial heart. But on a gleaming late-summer morning, there were those planes bearing down on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Suddenly, Americans had no sense of what the future might bring. As the shock and the tears subsided, faces that had been purposeful were newly diffident. And in the changed world of politics, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, prevented by New York City's term-limits law from seeking a third term, prepared to leave City Hall celebrating his much-heralded leadership.\",\n",

Reports by the Reuters and Agence France-Presse news services that appeared after midnight on Sunday in Islamabad quoted an unnamed senior security official as saying that Mr. Saeed, founder and leader until last week of the Army of the Pure, had been arrested ''for making inflammatory speeches to incite people to violate law and order.'' The arrest had appeared to be imminent for several days as Pakistan sought ways of defusing the crisis with India.\",\n",
