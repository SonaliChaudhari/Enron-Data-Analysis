       "     'lead_paragraph': 'Scotland has already given the world Robert Burns, Walter Scott and Donovan, and now an American professor says it is also the birthplace of rap battles. Ferenc Szasz, a professor of history at the University of New Mexico who specializes in American and Scottish culture, says in a new study that the lyrical tradition of battle rap derives from an ancient Caledonian practice called “flyting,” The Telegraph reported. Examples of flyting, a kind of verbal dueling in which opponents would trade rhyming (and often obscene) insults at each other, date at least as far back as the 16th century; Mr. Szasz said that Scottish slaveowners brought the practice to America, where it later evolved into hip-hop. Comparing practitioners of flyting and hip-hop performers, Mr. Szasz said: “Both cultures accord high marks to satire. The skilled use of satire takes this verbal jousting to its ultimate level — one step short of a fistfight.”',\n",

       "     'lead_paragraph': 'At least as far back as “Take the Money and Run,” Woody Allen has been trying to draw attention away from his musical abilities. (As a frustrated cello teacher recalls of his character, Virgil Starkwell, in that fake documentary: “He had no conception of the instrument. He was blowing into it.”) But on Sunday, Mr. Allen shared his clarinet skills with an audience of nearly 3,000 listeners at a concert in Warsaw, The Associated Press reported. The rare concert at which Mr. Allen performed outside his hometown was held at Warsaw’s Sala Kongresowa, and featured the filmmaker playing traditional jazz numbers with his New Orleans Jazz Band. “We will do our best to entertain you,” Mr. Allen told the audience, according to The A.P., before the start of the two-hour show, during which he performed several solos. Outside of Mr. Allen’s appearances at the Cafe Carlyle, his clarinet work can also be heard in the score to “Sleeper,” and in the documentary “Wild Man Blues,” about his band’s 1996 tour of Europe.',\n",
