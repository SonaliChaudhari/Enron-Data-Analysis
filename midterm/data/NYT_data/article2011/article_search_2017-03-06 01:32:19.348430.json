And some of it was significant. There was the swearing in of a president after the Supreme Court decided the presidential election. There was the death of the legendary driver Dale Earnhardt in a stock car crash. There was Cal Ripken's retirement after 3,001 games, including a record 2,632 in a row (and 3,184 hits, 1,695 runs batted in and 431 homers). There was Robert Tools's quiet thumbs-up after becoming the first recipient of a self-contained artificial heart.

As the shock and the tears subsided, faces that had been purposeful were newly diffident. And in the changed world of politics, Mayor Rudolph W.
